This regression model summary provides coefficients and p-values of variables included in 13 models of different complexity as indicated by the number of factors used for each model. From the summary, one can see that the most significant variables used in the models are Variable 1 and Variable 3, with coefficients of 0.002593954919163511 and 0.269364493169521 respectively and associated p-values of 3.456006392841526e-18 and 1.0114803816300523e-11. These variables are likely to be strong predictors and should be prioritized over the other variables when forecasting.

The p-value of Variable 2 is slightly higher than the other variables, with
